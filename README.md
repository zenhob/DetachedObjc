# Detached

This is a simple terminal session manager that sits in your MacOS menu bar. Use it to create
detachable terminal sessions that persist until you restart or logout. It's an easy way for
developers to monitor long-running terminal applications without them cluttering your view.

## Features

* Creates detachable terminal sessions that you can close until you need them again
* Menu bar icon tells you whether you have detached sessions
* Warns about detached sessions on quit
* Uses either the built-in Terminal or iTerm
