# Detached

This is a simple terminal session manager that sits in your MacOS menu bar. It uses GNU Screen to
create detachable terminal sessions that you can close and forget about until you need them later.
It's also an easy way for developers to monitor long-running terminal applications without them
cluttering your view.
